# SIMPLE-AI-TRANSCRIBER

****audio.py****
transcribes what is said in the audio into text.
it transcribes only audio files of .wav & .flac type.
I have attached three sample .wav files.


Use FormatFactory software to convert any audio file to a .wav or .flac file
Uses GOOGLE API & internet for recognition
